## Executive Summary

The reviewed literature did not provide sufficient citation impact data to identify the most cited articles definitively; however, foundational works include Harding et al. (2011) on model data-sharing agreements, Diver et al. (2019) on Treatment as State water governance policy, and Leonard et al. (2021) on the WAMPUM adaptation framework, with the CARE Principles emerging as the most widely referenced framework across environmental data sovereignty contexts.

## Abstract

This systematic review of 22 sources found that comprehensive citation impact data was largely unavailable across the literature on Indigenous data sovereignty frameworks for environmental and climate data sharing. Most studies did not report citation counts, citations per year, or journal impact factors, limiting the ability to identify the most cited articles definitively. However, several sources demonstrated influence through alternative indicators, including policy adoption, federal funding, and framework development that has shaped subsequent practice. The CARE Principles (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics) emerged as the most frequently referenced framework across environmental data contexts, documented in six sources spanning fire management, forestry, ecological monitoring, and climate research. Novel frameworks developed specifically for environmental contexts include the Indigenous Fire Data Sovereignty framework, the WAMPUM adaptation framework for sea level rise, and tribally-specific protocols such as the Karuk Tribe's Practicing Pikyav.

The literature reveals significant complexity in multi-jurisdictional data sharing, with studies documenting coordination challenges across tribal, federal, state, and international boundaries. Key barriers include conflicts between university open research policies and tribal data sovereignty requirements, federal agency control over self-governance agreements, and persistent colonial infrastructure in land management institutions. Successful mechanisms identified include Treatment as State provisions enabling 44 tribes to set independent water quality standards, inter-tribal bridging organizations facilitating networked capacity, and formal data-sharing agreements ensuring tribal data ownership. The evidence consistently supports that Indigenous communities have inherent rights to control environmental data about their territories, but implementation requires context-specific protocols, adequate institutional resources, and fundamental restructuring of traditional academic-Indigenous research relationships.

## Methodology

### Paper Search

A semantic search was performed using the query "What are the most cited journal articles on Indigenous data sovereignty frameworks for climate and environmental data sharing across multiple jurisdictions and institutions?" across over 138 million academic papers from the Elicit search engine, which includes all of Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex.

The 499 papers most relevant to the query were retrieved.

### Screening

Sources were screened based on their abstracts using the following criteria:

- **Indigenous Data Sovereignty Focus:** Does this article primarily address Indigenous peoples' rights, governance, or control over data collection, management, and use?
- **Environmental Data Context:** Does this study specifically discuss data related to climate change, environmental monitoring, natural resources, or ecological systems?
- **Multi-jurisdictional or Multi-institutional Scope:** Does this article address data sharing across different governmental jurisdictions (local, regional, national, international) or between multiple institutions/organizations?
- **Framework or Governance Focus:** Does this article discuss frameworks, policies, protocols, or governance structures (rather than focusing purely on technical or methodological approaches)?
- **Peer-reviewed Publication:** Is this article published in an academic journal with a peer review process (not a conference proceeding, report, or grey literature)?
- **Indigenous-Specific Approach:** Does this article include specific attention to Indigenous rights or perspectives (rather than focusing solely on general data governance or open data initiatives without Indigenous considerations)?
- **Governance Rather Than Technical Focus:** Does this article address governance or sovereignty frameworks (rather than focusing exclusively on technical implementation, software development, or data processing methods)?
- **Tribal Sociopolitical Status:** Is the study specific to United States federally recognized Tribes?

All screening questions were considered together, and a holistic judgement was made about whether to screen in each paper.

### Data Extraction

A large language model was used to extract each data column from each paper. The model was given the following extraction instructions for each column:

**Citation Impact:** Extract citation and impact data including total citation count (from Google Scholar, Web of Science, or Scopus), citations per year since publication, journal impact factor or ranking, journal name and publication year, and any evidence of high influence (e.g., policy citations, framework adoption).

**Indigenous Sovereignty Frameworks:** Extract all Indigenous data sovereignty frameworks, principles, or approaches discussed including specific framework names (e.g., CARE principles, OCAP, tribal data policies), key principles or components described, how frameworks are operationalized or implemented, Indigenous governance structures or processes mentioned, and sovereignty assertions or rights claimed.

**Environmental Data Context:** Extract details about environmental and climate data contexts including types of environmental data (water quality, fire management, ecological, climate, etc.), specific environmental domains or ecosystems studied, data collection methods or monitoring approaches, scale of environmental data (local, regional, national), and connection to climate change or environmental management.

**Multi-Jurisdictional Elements:** Extract information about jurisdictional scope and cross-boundary aspects including specific jurisdictions involved (tribal, federal, state, provincial, international), cross-boundary data sharing challenges or solutions, inter-governmental relationships or agreements, jurisdictional conflicts or coordination mechanisms, and multi-institutional collaborations described.

**Institutional Context:** Extract details about institutions and organizational relationships including types of institutions involved (universities, tribal governments, federal agencies, NGOs), specific institutions named, power dynamics or institutional constraints described, collaborative models or partnership structures, and policy conflicts between institutional requirements.

**Data Sharing Approaches:** Extract information about data sharing governance and practices including data ownership and control mechanisms, data sharing protocols or agreements, access restrictions or permissions processes, technology platforms or systems used, ethical considerations or guidelines for sharing, and community consent or engagement processes.

**Study Type:** Identify the type of study and research approach including study design (case study, framework development, empirical research, review, etc.), research methods used (interviews, document analysis, participatory methods, etc.), theoretical vs. practical focus, and whether it presents new frameworks or analyzes existing ones.

**Key Contributions:** Extract the main findings, recommendations, or contributions including primary conclusions about Indigenous data sovereignty, practical recommendations for implementation, challenges or barriers identified, success factors or best practices, gaps or future research needs identified, and policy implications discussed.

## Citation Impact and Influence

A notable limitation of this review is the scarcity of citation impact data across included sources. Most papers did not report citation counts, citations per year, or journal impact factors. However, several sources provided evidence of influence through alternative indicators.

| Study | Journal | Evidence of Influence |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| A. Harding et al., 2011 | Environmental Health Perspectives | Model data-sharing agreement for policy and practice |
| S. Diver et al., 2019 | Not mentioned | Discusses TAS as model for UNDRIP self-determination |
| K. Leonard et al., 2021 | Not mentioned | Proposes WAMPUM framework for Indigenous climate adaptation |
| Seafha C. Ramos et al., 2024 | Molecular Ecology Resources | Special issue elevating Indigenous scientists' work |
| Clarita Lefthand-Begay et al., 2024 | Not mentioned | Initiated in response to Biden administration call; NSF-funded |
| Helen Fillmore et al., 2021a | Not mentioned | USDA-funded; results disseminated to tribal nations |

The absence of comprehensive citation data reflects a broader challenge in the field: many Indigenous data sovereignty frameworks are relatively recent developments, and traditional bibliometric measures may underestimate their policy influence and practical adoption within Indigenous communities.

## Indigenous Data Sovereignty Frameworks

The reviewed literature identifies multiple frameworks addressing Indigenous data sovereignty in environmental and climate contexts. These frameworks range from internationally recognized principles to tribally-specific protocols developed for particular communities.

### Established Principles and Guidelines

| Framework | Key Components | Sources Discussing |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| CARE Principles | Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics | Adams et al., 2024; Yanchapaxi et al., 2025; Doğan et al., 2023; Jennings et al., 2025; Wick et al., 2024; Lefthand-Begay et al., 2024 |
| FAIR Principles | Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable | Adams et al., 2024; Doğan et al., 2023; Jennings et al., 2025 |
| OCAP Principles | Ownership, Control, Access, Possession | Adams et al., 2024; Yanchapaxi et al., 2025 |
| TRUST Principles | Transparency, Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability, Technology | Jennings et al., 2025 |

The CARE Principles emerged as the most frequently referenced framework across the literature, with six sources explicitly discussing their application to environmental data governance. These principles were developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA) to operationalize Indigenous data sovereignty into governance. The CARE Principles are described as more people-oriented and purpose-oriented than mainstream data principles, emphasizing that data should benefit Indigenous communities rather than merely being technically accessible.

### Novel Frameworks Developed

Several sources introduced new frameworks specifically designed for environmental and climate data contexts:

| Framework | Developer | Key Features | Environmental Focus |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Indigenous Fire Data Sovereignty (IFDS) | Adams et al., 2024 | Right of Indigenous communities to govern fire data; integrates UNDRIP, CARE principles | Fire management and cultural burning |
| WAMPUM Adaptation Framework | Leonard et al., 2021 | Witness, Acknowledge, Mend, Protect, Unite, Move | Sea level rise and water security |
| Piikani Well-being Index | Paul et al., 2023 | 80 variables across human health, agriculture, cultural systems | Environmental stewardship at watershed scales |
| Model Material and Data-Sharing Agreement (MDSA) | Harding et al., 2011 | Equal partnership, data ownership, mutual review processes | Natural resource research |
| Four Rs Framework | Brewer et al., 2023 | Relationship, Responsibility, Reciprocity, Redistribution | Climate change, fisheries, wildlife |

The WAMPUM framework specifically addresses the absence of Indigenous knowledge in existing sea level rise adaptation frameworks, emphasizing that adaptation frameworks must be designed by Indigenous Peoples for Indigenous Peoples. The framework builds on lessons from eastern coastal Tribal Nations and provides adaptation measures guided by Indigenous knowledge systems.

### Tribally-Specific Protocols

| Protocol | Tribal Nation | Key Features |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Practicing Pikyav | Karuk Tribe | Research oversight by Pikyav Review Committee; tribal retention of data rights; prevails over external IRBs |
| Pikyav Research Agreement | Karuk Tribe | Ensures tribal knowledge sovereignty, data ownership, control over access |
| Treatment as State (TAS) | 44 U.S. tribes | Enables tribes to set water quality standards independently; can incorporate cultural uses |

The Karuk Tribe's Practicing Pikyav protocol represents a comprehensive approach where the tribe retains all rights to data and research products, with project proposals requiring review and approval by the Karuk Resources Advisory Board. This protocol emphasizes that Indigenous research sovereignty is about research enacted and implemented by Indigenous people, upholding their tribally specific knowledge and frameworks.

---

## Multi-Jurisdictional Coordination

The literature reveals significant complexity in navigating data sovereignty across tribal, federal, state, and international jurisdictions.

### Jurisdictional Scope

| Jurisdictional Configuration | Examples | Key Challenges |
|-----------------------------|----------|----------------|
| Tribal-Federal | Karuk Tribe/U.S. Forest Service; CATG/USFWS | Federal agencies controlling self-governance agreements; recognition of tribal expertise |
| Tribal-Federal-State | St. Louis River estuary study; TAS implementation | Conflicting data ownership policies; hostility from neighboring states |
| Multi-Tribal Networks | Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council; Indigenous Observation Network | Building networked capacity across nations |
| International | Australia, Canada, U.S. fire research; Canada, U.S., New Zealand, Australia | Lack of accountability for extractive companies |

### Cross-Boundary Data Sharing Challenges

Several sources identified specific barriers to data sharing across jurisdictions:

- **Policy conflicts:** University openness in research policies often conflict with tribal data sovereignty policies, creating delays and barriers to collaboration. One study documented a research delay of nearly a year due to conflicting data ownership requirements between a university and tribal government.
- **Jurisdictional gaps:** Tribes often lack jurisdiction over lands held by corporations or federal/state governments, and self-governance agreements frequently favor federal agencies.
- **Protection of Indigenous knowledge:** There is ongoing tension between ensuring data is accessible and actionable while protecting Indigenous knowledge from inappropriate disclosure. Some authors call for exemptions from Freedom of Information Act requirements to protect sensitive cultural information.

### Inter-Governmental Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Function | Source |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Annual Funding Agreements (AFAs) | Ensure tribal needs are met in federal partnerships | Brewer et al., 2023 |
| Interagency Agreements | Coordinate between U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs | Diver et al., 2016 |
| Western Klamath Restoration Partnership | Multi-stakeholder forest restoration coordination | Thoreson et al., 2024 |
| EPA TAS Provisions | Enable tribes to set water quality standards | Diver et al., 2019 |
| Biden Administration Guidelines | Incorporating Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge into federal decision-making | Lefthand-Begay et al., 2024 |

The Treatment as State (TAS) policy under the Clean Water Act represents one of the most developed mechanisms for Indigenous environmental governance. Forty-four U.S. tribes have enacted TAS tribal standards, which may be more stringent than those of neighboring states and can incorporate cultural and ceremonial uses. However, TAS programs do not fully support tribes as a third sovereign; they privilege Western, bureaucratic frameworks and do not address colonial legacies.

---

## Institutional Relationships and Power Dynamics

### Institutional Configurations

The studies describe complex institutional relationships involving universities, tribal governments, federal agencies, and NGOs:

| Institution Type | Role | Key Tensions |
|-----------------|------|--------------|
| Universities | Research partners, data collection | Open research policies vs. tribal data sovereignty; IRB conflicts with tribal protocols |
| Tribal Governments | Data owners, research directors | Limited resources for IRB operations; need for greater recognition |
| Federal Agencies | Land managers, funders, regulators | Final authority over tribal programs; colonial infrastructure |
| NGOs/Bridging Organizations | Coordination, capacity building | Building networked capacity |

### Power Dynamics and Constraints

Multiple sources identify persistent power imbalances:

- **Colonial infrastructure:** Federal agencies often maintain colonial infrastructure that prioritizes Western conservation paradigms over Indigenous Knowledge Systems. Plenary power and lack of incorporation of tribal feedback into decision-making processes remain significant barriers.
- **Institutional constraints:** Tribal governments may lack adequate resources to support tribal IRBs and research advisors. Federal agencies have significant control over self-governance agreements, frequently disadvantaging tribal communities.
- **Knowledge hierarchies:** There is often undervaluation of Indigenous contributions compared to equivalent work by majority groups, and tensions arise from misappropriation and marginalization of Indigenous language, culture, and worldviews by the scientific establishment.

### Collaborative Models

Despite these challenges, several studies document successful partnership structures:

| Model | Key Features | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Indigenous-Directed Research (IDR) | Research questions and methodologies co-developed; tribal priorities centered | Karuk black oak monitoring |
| Pivot Points Approach | Identifying leverage within existing policies to shift management | Karuk/USFS co-management |
| Co-Management | Shared governance of protected areas | Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument |
| Community-Based Monitoring | Indigenous-led data collection as expression of governance | Indigenous Observation Network |

The concept of pivot points describes how Indigenous communities can simultaneously follow existing state policies and subvert them to shift federal forest management. This approach recognizes that co-management, while imperfect, can serve as an interim strategy to build tribal capacity and increase equity in natural resource management.

---

## Data Sharing Governance Practices

### Data Ownership and Control

| Approach | Key Features | Sources |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Tribal ownership | All data transferred to tribal ownership; tribes retain rights to research products | Thoreson et al., 2024; Murveit et al., 2023 |
| Joint ownership with exceptions | Joint ownership except for Traditional Indigenous Intellectual Property (TIIP) | Wick et al., 2024 |
| Community consent | Consent must be understood and given throughout research process; right to refuse and withdraw | Adams et al., 2024 |
| Authority to control | Indigenous Peoples have authority over their own data | Yanchapaxi et al., 2025 |

### Access Protocols

Data access mechanisms vary considerably across contexts:

- **Restricted access:** Data may not be publicly available, with access possible only through formal research agreements or nondisclosure agreements.
- **Embargo provisions:** Some frameworks include community requirements around data obfuscation, embargos, and access restrictions, with metadata documentation and Local Context Notices.
- **Publication rights:** Tribal governments may retain the right to approve or deny publication of research findings if deemed harmful.

### Ethical Guidelines

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Free, prior, and informed consent | Required for data collection and publication; formal consent from tribal governments recommended |
| Preventing harm | Data control to prevent harm and ensure tribal sovereignty; minimizing harm and maximizing benefits |
| Reciprocity | Returning data to communities for conservation and management; building relationships and capacity |
| Transparency | Equal responsibility; informed consent forms; confidentiality agreements |

## Thematic Analysis

### Theme 1: Tension Between Open Science and Indigenous Data Sovereignty

A central theme across the literature is the fundamental tension between open science principles and Indigenous data sovereignty requirements. The question of what processes are needed to follow open science protocols while upholding Indigenous Peoples' rights emerges as a critical concern.

University open research policies that do not explicitly address Indigenous sovereignty fall short of the open research principles they intend to support. These policies often prioritize academic freedom to publish freely while retaining university control of data, creating direct conflicts with tribal data ownership policies. Multiple authors call for revision of university policies to include explicit exceptions for Indigenous partnerships.

### Theme 2: Colonial Legacies and Structural Barriers

The literature consistently identifies colonial legacies as fundamental barriers to Indigenous data sovereignty. Settler-colonial experiences have associated data and maps as tools of dispossession, disparity, and disempowerment. However, Indigenous-led statistics and mapping efforts can yield powerful tools for Nations in addressing interconnected wellness while honoring collectively held knowledge and community protocols.

Colonial entanglements both enable and constrain enhanced Indigenous self-determination. While mechanisms like TAS policy create opportunities for Indigenous water governance, they still privilege Western, bureaucratic frameworks and do not fully address colonial legacies.

### Theme 3: Indigenous Knowledge as Foundation for Adaptation

Multiple sources emphasize that Indigenous Knowledge, Practice, and Belief Systems provide essential foundations for climate adaptation. Traditional and Indigenous knowledge can provide historical baselines, fill gaps in monitoring data, identify vulnerable cultural resources, and identify potential adaptation strategies.

The unique adaptive capacities of tribal communities stem from their ethics and knowledge, helping frame and guide successful adaptation. However, Indigenous communities face significant institutional constraints when implementing practices such as cultural burning, highlighting the need for Indigenous-led research projects, programs, and political action.

### Theme 4: Research Fatigue and Extractive Practices

Several sources document the burden placed on Indigenous communities by research demands. Alaska Native communities in the Yukon Flats are experiencing research fatigue due to extraordinary numbers of researchers applying constant pressure to engage with research ideas that are not aligned with community needs.

Climate adaptation initiatives often ask Indigenous peoples to provide knowledge and resources to assist with adaptation efforts beyond their communities, which can limit their capacity to act locally. The literature emphasizes that research should prioritize Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination rather than knowledge extraction.

### Theme 5: Capacity Building and Indigenous Leadership

A consistent recommendation across sources is the need for increased Indigenous leadership in environmental research and data governance. Indigenous governments must take a leading role in community-based monitoring programs, and networked capacity between Indigenous governments can be built using bridging organizations.

Education and capacity building emerge as critical components of data sovereignty frameworks. Integrating Indigenous approaches into curricula can foster interest and confidence in scientific research among Indigenous undergraduates, preparing a diverse future workforce. Returning individualised data to communities aids in conservation and management while building local capacity.

---

## Synthesis

The reviewed literature reveals substantial consensus on core principles while demonstrating significant heterogeneity in implementation approaches across different environmental domains, geographic contexts, and institutional configurations.

### Convergent Findings

Across all 22 sources, there is convergence on several fundamental principles:

1. **Indigenous communities have inherent rights to control data about themselves and their territories.** This principle is articulated through various frameworks—CARE, OCAP, Practicing Pikyav—but the underlying assertion remains consistent.

2. **Equal partnership in research requires restructuring traditional academic-Indigenous relationships.** Tribes must be truly equal partners in study design, data collection, interpretation, and publication.

3. **Environmental data governance cannot be separated from broader sovereignty claims.** Community-based monitoring is understood as both a method for generating useful data and an expression of governance itself, rooted in understandings of stewardship, kinship, and responsibility.

### Explaining Divergent Implementation Approaches

The variation in specific protocols and mechanisms across sources reflects several contextual factors:

**Environmental domain specificity:** Fire management contexts require different data governance approaches than water quality monitoring or climate adaptation planning. The IFDS framework addresses unique challenges of protecting Indigenous Knowledge from disclosure while ensuring data is actionable for fire management, while TAS policy mechanisms address water quality governance through regulatory frameworks.

**Institutional capacity variation:** Tribal nations with established research infrastructure, such as the Karuk Tribe with its Pikyav Review Committee, can implement more comprehensive data governance protocols than communities with limited resources. The need for adequate resource allocation to support tribal IRBs remains a persistent challenge.

**Jurisdictional complexity:** Studies operating within single tribal-federal relationships describe different mechanisms than those navigating multi-tribal networks or international contexts. The Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council coordinates across Yukon and BC First Nations as well as Alaska Native Tribes, requiring bridging organization approaches that differ from single-tribe frameworks.

### Contextual Applicability of Findings

The reviewed frameworks demonstrate varying applicability depending on specific circumstances:

- **TAS policy** provides a model for Indigenous water co-governance within federal systems but requires federal recognition status and does not address non-water environmental domains.
- **WAMPUM framework** specifically addresses sea level rise adaptation for eastern coastal Tribal Nations and may require adaptation for inland or western communities.
- **Practicing Pikyav** represents a tribally-specific protocol developed for Karuk contexts that may not be directly transferable but provides principles applicable across tribal research contexts.
- **CARE Principles** offer the most broadly applicable framework, with documented application across fire management, forestry, ecological monitoring, and climate research contexts.

### Implications for Multi-Jurisdictional Data Sharing

For practitioners and policymakers seeking to implement Indigenous data sovereignty in multi-jurisdictional environmental contexts, the literature suggests several key considerations:

1. **Formal agreements are essential but must be tailored** to specific tribal-institutional relationships. The MDSA approach provides a model template, but agreements must reflect each tribe's specific governance protocols and sovereignty assertions.

2. **Bridging organizations facilitate coordination across jurisdictions**, but Indigenous governments must take leading roles rather than serving as consultants to outside researchers.

3. **Policy reform is needed at institutional and federal levels** to address structural barriers, including university open research policies and federal agency practices that maintain colonial infrastructure.

4. **Long-term relationship building precedes effective data sharing.** The emphasis on reciprocity, trust, and ongoing engagement across multiple sources indicates that data governance cannot be reduced to contractual arrangements alone.
