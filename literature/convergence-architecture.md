# Convergence Systems Architecture: The Relationality of Indigenous, Network, and Digital Sovereignty


Information communication technology offers Indigenous Peoples opportunities for cultural revitalization, political mobilization, and global solidarity; however they also threaten cultural appropriation, political dissolution, and individual disconnect. The underlying architectures of these complex systems, from raw material extraction, to compute infrastructure, to energy and natural resource consumption all have trade-offs. So it is important to converge at all aspects of your individual, collective, and federated decision-making to be mindful and practical on how you utilize "data" and to always be vigilant that you are not used by it. Mr. Phil Two Eagle (Sicangu Oyate) has said "We have to respect the Thunder beings, the electricity that make these machines work..." He offered this in many spaces, with permission to share with others, not as a warning, but a reminder. We must always first remember our humanity, that we are not apart from the natural world; we are a part of it. Our artifacts, from roads, to computers, to clay pots, these are all manufactured... made by human hands. Before we can define or govern data we must always converge knowledge systems within a digital space with the lived experiences of ourselves and each other, and to recognize one another as relatives. All Beings (human or otherwise) have inherent rights; all Beings have inherent responsibilities. So now and always we must first remember and Respect who we are, the Peoples we come from, and our place within the natural world. We must honor all that form the makeup of our experience; all that are required for our very existence. Once this grounding has occurred, we may better navigate both the opportunities and threats of our contemporary ways of Life, with Spirit and Reason, so that we may act from a place of 

**Honor, Pride, and Respect.**



## Introduction: The Determination of Knowledge and Information


Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDSov), Digital Sovereignty, and Network Sovereignty require definition. Academic and policy language typically treats these three pillars as distinct domains. Indigenous Data Sovereignty is often categorized as simply "who owns the data?" Or perceiving both data and encoding as strictly computationally-centered process. When an Elder tells a child a story, the story is data; the Elder shares the data with the child, and then the child has the responsibility to either hold or share that data. **Indigenous Data Sovereignty**, as best as I know it, also means that not just "what" is shared, but "who" has the right to share it; also how, when, why, etc. is the underlying "metadata" in this case. In my experience, this has been very hard for many to understand. Indigenous Data may be only seen as a recording of an Elder speaking, or geospatial coordinates that show where certain culturally significant plants may grow, and this is still Indigenous data, however it is not the bounding limitation of it. When data as information transforms into the digital space of 1s and 0s, it gets relegated to archives, mined for content, incorporated into massive decades long record of health statistics, and with limited asides within research ethics and philosophy. **Network Sovereignty** often falls under telecommunications policy, the "digital divide," and rural infrastructure, etc. But a better way to think of it is how Tribes are able to interconnect with one another, often within ICT domains. An poignant example of network sovereignty in practice was demonstrated by Dr. Dennis Dye and his students at the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI), who installed a local weather tower to measure wind, temperature, humidity, and other environmental data. They were able to pull this information into a local server (just a small desktop computer) and share it with other Tribal Colleges and connect with the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research and National Center for Atmospheric Research (UCAR/NCAR) in Boulder, CO, all without corporate governance mediating the exchange. The antithesis of this are platforms we take for granted (social media, workspace suites) where the fine print reveals that what you include in their space, while "yours," is not only yours; the networks you transmit through also claim a piece of your information. Network sovereignty means that what you share, who you share it with, why, how, and when are negotiated decisions with clear utility and consent. **Digital Sovereignty**, often confused with both data and network sovereignty is defined as "the ability of Tribal Nations to control and manage digital infrastructure, data and technologies in ways that support self-determination and protect community interests" (Morris et al. 2025). The fundamental principle here is of sovereignty... the right of the individual, the community, the Nation, to determine the application of knowledges and information.

This document explores **Convergence Systems Architecture** through a comprehensive review of central scholars that have been prolific in this domain. Dr. Dominique David-Chavez, Dr. Lydia Jennings, Dr. Stephanie Russo Carroll, Dr. Tahu Kukutai, Dr. Maggie Walter, Dr. Marisa Elena Duarte, who have built compendia of literature, conducted research and analysis, and most importantly have the lived experience to share their wisdom; the intent to strengthen the knowledge base of these aspects of sovereignty so that others may build from them. reveals these distinctions are collapsing. A sovereign data ecosystem cannot exist without architecture at the fundamental level of transformation of information into code; however before this "transliteration" occurs, there must be philosophy of practice. This analysis utilizes a convergence framework synthesizing the work of these scholars. It begins with connection to Place and the critique of extractive research models, and then moves through governance frameworks designed to protect Indigenous knowledge, examines physical and spectral infrastructure required to transmit that knowledge, and concludes with Indigenous AI and computational sovereignty.



## Core Pillar I: Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDSov) and the Governance Layer

The foundational layer of Indigenous Data Sovereignty or IDSov is the right of Indigenous Peoples to govern collection, ownership, and application of data about their peoples, lands, and resources. It provides the ethical specifications for how the entire system functions—the legal and moral code dictating information flow through the network.

### From Inclusion to Sovereignty

Indigenous engagement with Western science and technology has moved from exclusion to inclusion to sovereignty. Early paradigms excluded Indigenous Peoples entirely or treated them as subjects of study; "inclusion" models sought to bring Indigenous Peoples into Western datasets and grant access to Western internet infrastructure. Inclusion without structural change accelerates extraction, what scholars describe as "digital colonialism."

Dr. Dominique David-Chavez's work on the Relational Science Model and Dr. Lydia Jennings' critique of the Open Science ecosystem demonstrate that "opening" data or "connecting" communities causes harm when governance structures are not Indigenous-led. Effective governance integrating the principles of IDSov requires fundamental re-engineering where software (governance protocols like CARE), hardware (network infrastructure and spectrum), and community values and biocultural Knowledge are mutually reinforcing; the question is not whether Indigenous Peoples have access to technology, but whether they determine how, when, why, and with whom that technology operates.

### From "Data Deficits" to "Data for Governance"

The demographic and statistical work of Dr. Tahu Kukutai and Dr. Maggie Walter challenges the epistemological foundations of how Indigenous Data is collected and used by settler-colonial states. Dr. Maggie Walter introduces the term "5D Data" to describe the standard colonial approach to Indigenous statistics: data used to highlight Disparity, Deprivation, Disadvantage, Dysfunction, and Difference. This deficit narrative justifies state intervention and paternalism while obscuring community strengths, resilience, and vitality; the data collected is data about Indigenous Peoples, used for state administration, not data for Indigenous Peoples to exercise self-determination. IDSov advocates for "Data for Governance" rather than "Governance of Data." This distinction, elaborated in Indigenous Data Sovereignty: Toward an Agenda (2016), argues that Tribes need data reflecting their own worldviews and priorities (language fluency rates, intergenerational Knowledge transfer, environmental health metrics) rather than comparative statistics with non-Indigenous populations. Dr. Tahu Kukutai expands on this by identifying risks of "statistical genocide" within national censuses. When data systems fail to accurately capture Tribal affiliation or rely on aggregate categories that mask distinct national identities, they erase Indigenous existence in the policy landscape.

### Operationalizing Ethics: The CARE Principles

Dr. Dominique David-Chavez and Dr. Stephanie Russo Carroll demonstrate that "Open Data" often conflicts with Indigenous protections. The principle "As open as possible, as closed as necessary" encapsulates the coherent approach: technical standards ensuring interoperability (FAIR) combined with governance standards ensuring sovereignty (CARE). If the "what" of Indigenous Data Sovereignty is sovereign data, the "how" is the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance. Developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA) with leadership from Dr. Stephanie Russo Carroll, CARE represents the most significant global framework for operationalizing IDSov in the era of Big Data. CARE was designed to complement and critique the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) used in Western scientific data management; FAIR focuses on data characteristics that facilitate machine-readability and sharing, but remains silent on human relationships, power dynamics, and ethical obligations.

**Collective Benefit:** Data ecosystems must enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit, countering extractive history where value was exported to academic or corporate centers.

**Authority to Control:** Indigenous rights and interests must be recognized and their authority to control data empowered, including rights to repatriate data and refuse participation.

**Responsibility:** Those working with data have responsibility to share how data supports Indigenous self-determination.

**Ethics:** Indigenous rights and wellbeing must be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle.

CARE recenters these relationships: **Collective Benefit** ensures that data ecosystems are designed to support Indigenous self-determination, governance, and wellbeing; **Authority to Control** recognizes the inherent rights of Indigenous Nations to govern data collection, access, and application; **Responsibility** obligates those working with Indigenous Data to nurture respectful relationships and build capacity within communities; and **Ethics** requires that Indigenous Peoples' rights, worldviews, and cultural protocols guide data practices throughout their lifecycle. Where FAIR answers whether data can be shared, CARE asks whether it should be, by whom, under what conditions, and toward what purpose.

### The Relational Science Model

Dr. Dominique David-Chavez provides methodological scaffolding for this governance layer. Her work on the Relational Science Model critiques extractive colonial science where researchers "parachute" into communities to extract data without building capacity or relationships; relationality, in contrast, recognizes that meaningful research emerges through dialogue and collective participation rather than transmission from source to receiver, and that trust is built gradually through sustained engagement rather than transactional exchange. In her analysis of global Indigenous ethics guidelines, David-Chavez identifies that sovereignty in research requires moving up the "scale of engagement" from consultation to Indigenous-led and Indigenous-determined research. This involves implementing Tribal Research Codes with the force of law, requiring external researchers to undergo Tribal IRB review and adhere to community protocols regarding data sharing and intellectual property. This legal infrastructure transforms ethical "guidelines" into enforceable governance.


## Core Pillar II: Interrelationality as Principle and not Phenomenon

**Convergence Systems Architecture** recognizes that data is material, biological and geological. Dr. Lydia Jennings bridges the gap between ecological sovereignty and data sovereignty, forcing reconsideration of what constitutes "Indigenous Data" beyond cultural artifacts and health records to include soil samples, water quality metrics, and biodiversity data. Convergence, in this context, does not mean homogenization or unification; in mathematical terms, two lines converge by growing closer and closer yet never intersecting. When different Peoples with different worldviews and Knowledge systems converge, they do not arrive at a single point of agreement but rather orient themselves around a shared problem or purpose. Each retains their identity, their methods, their ways of knowing; yet the distance between them narrows as they work toward addressing what they mutually understand requires collective attention. Jennings' work demonstrates this in practice: Indigenous Ecological Knowledge(s) and Western environmental sciences converge upon the question of how to understand and protect living systems, each contributing perspectives that neither could offer alone, while the integrity of each remains intact.

### Extraction: Resource Mining to Data Mining

Extraction operates through the same logic whether it targets minerals or meaning. When data as information moves into digital systems, it gets relegated to archives, mined for content, incorporated into decades-long records; the processes that transform Knowledge into commodity mirror the processes that transform land into resource. In both cases, what belongs to a People becomes raw material for external benefit. Dr. Daniel Wildcat reminds us that Indigenous Peoples speak of "relatives not resources," to treat your relatives as resources is both disrespectful and harmful. Extraction without beneficence is, by definition, harm. Jennings draws on expertise as a soil scientist and policy scholar to argue that extraction logic is identical in metal mining and data mining. Settler-colonialism viewed Indigenous lands as terra nullius available for mineral extraction; the modern data economy views Indigenous Knowledge and biophysical data as "raw resources" available for harvesting. In both cases, value is extracted and exported to the metropole (universities, corporations, urban centers) while "waste" (toxic tailings or harmful narratives) is left in the community. Jennings' work on mining land reclamation serves as metaphor for data landscape reclamation. Just as soil must be remediated to support life, data ecosystems must be remediated to support Indigenous futurities; the question is not whether data will be generated from Indigenous lands and Peoples, but whether that data becomes a resource for self-determination or an extracted commodity serving external interests.

### Relatives, Not Resources: Data Sovereignty and the Living World

Biophysical Data Sovereignty positions data generated from the land (soil health, plant biodiversity, water chemistry) is inherently Indigenous Data because it reflects relationships Indigenous Peoples have held with that land since time immemorial. The conceptualization of body autonomy, expressed beyond individual physiology, extends to the natural world: the foods we eat, the lands we walk on, the water we drink, and also how we ourselves hold relationships with these other Beings... our relatives. This reframing brings Internet of Things sensors, satellite remote sensing, and environmental monitoring networks under the Indigenous Data Sovereignty umbrella; the data is not "environmental" in some neutral sense, but relational, emerging from and belonging to the living systems and the Peoples who have stewarded them across generations. Jennings collaborates with Dr. Dominique David-Chavez and Dr. Stephanie Russo Carroll to apply CARE principles to ecology and biodiversity research, extending governance frameworks beyond cultural artifacts and health records to encompass the biophysical world itself.

The "Water Back" framework links the Land Back movement to Data Back, yet it is important to think of water reclamation outside of commodity framing; water is not a resource to be managed but a relative to be in relationship with. True sovereignty over water requires sovereignty over water data; if the state controls hydrological data, they control scarcity and allocation narratives, and by extension, they control the legal and political terrain upon which water rights are contested. Here it becomes important to distinguish "control" from "determination" and to move from "rights" to "responsibilities"; much gets lost in definitions, and the language of control can obscure the deeper question of what obligations we hold to our relatives and to future generations. Treaty rights, salmon returns, traditional plants, and sacred sites all depend on data that Tribal Nations can generate, interpret, and deploy on their own terms. Data-sharing structures therefore include independent, Tribally-controlled environmental monitoring networks generating sovereign data for legal claims, stewardship responsibilities, and the exercise of self-determination across the lands and waters that have always sustained Indigenous Peoples.


## Core Pillar III: Network Sovereignty and the Infrastructure Layer

If Indigenous Data Sovereignty provides the laws (software), Network Sovereignty provides the territory (hardware). Without ownership of physical infrastructure, data sovereignty is difficult to enforce. Data may be legally held by a Tribe, but if it resides on servers and travels through fiber optic cables owned by entities that do not recognize Tribal jurisdiction, that sovereignty is precarious; governance without infrastructure is assertion without capacity.

### Expanding the Definition of Network Sovereignty

Dr. Marisa Elena Duarte's *Network Sovereignty: Building the Internet Across Indian Country* (2017) is a definitive text for this layer. Definition, in this sense, is not about assigning rigid boundaries to a term; it is better understood as resolution. A low-definition image lacks clarity, and details get lost or go unseen. To expand definition in this sense is to bring greater resolution, to broaden understanding from many perspectives, so that what was obscured becomes visible. Duarte shifts conversation from "digital divide" (a deficit model focusing on lack of access) to "network sovereignty" (a rights-based model focusing on infrastructure control). The framing matters: the digital divide positions Indigenous Peoples as behind, needing to catch up to an existing system; network sovereignty positions Indigenous Nations as determining what systems they choose to build and interconnect with. Tribes cannot be fully sovereign Nations in the 21st century without controlling information flows, and this includes physical fiber optic cables, microwave towers, internet exchange points, and spectrum frequencies. US internet infrastructure often follows historical pathways of colonial railroads and telegraph lines, physically reinforcing settler geographies and bypassing Tribal lands.

### The "Social Textures" of Connectivity

Network infrastructure is not neutral; it encodes the values and priorities of those who design it. In collaborative work with computer scientist Dr. Morgan Vigil-Hayes, Duarte explores "social textures" of connectivity in rural and Tribal communities, demonstrating that standard engineering metrics like "throughput" and "latency" fail to capture the relational value of connectivity in Indigenous contexts. Research on Tribal ISPs and mesh networks shows that Tribes design infrastructure differently: instead of routing traffic through distant commercial hubs (increasing latency and cost), Tribal networks prioritize connecting a Chapter House directly to a local health clinic or school. This network topology or "local routing" physically reflects community social structure and priorities rather than corporate efficiency.

### Manufactured Scarcity: Spectrum as Territory

The electromagnetic spectrum is often framed as a scarce resource requiring centralized management, yet scarcity is frequently manufactured through regulatory structures that advantage incumbent corporations over communities. Non-federal entities can generate spectrum through technologies like LoRa networks or local WiFi mesh systems, but regulatory asymmetries and entrenched advantages consistently favor those already holding licenses over those seeking to build anew. Companies hold spectrum over Tribal lands yet fail to build infrastructure, blocking Tribes from using frequencies that go unused; government agencies were given spectrum for free decades ago and face no economic incentive to use it efficiently. The result is artificial scarcity in high-demand areas while rural and Tribal territories remain underserved, not because the spectrum is unavailable, but because the rules governing its use were not written with Indigenous Peoples in mind.

To "manufacture" in this context, means designing collaborative systems that allow different Peoples with different worldviews to orient around a shared problem while each retains their identity, their methods, their ways of knowing. Applied to spectrum, this involves asserting Spectrum Sovereignty: Tribal rights to manage airwaves over their territories. Duarte and Vigil-Hayes explore technical solutions like opportunistic spectrum access and TV White Space (TVWS) use, which take advantage of unused frequencies between broadcast channels. These approaches allow Tribes to build networks physically and logically distinct from the open internet, enabling higher degrees of data sovereignty and security. The question shifts from whether Tribes have access to connectivity, to whether they determine the architecture of that connectivity, who it serves, how it operates, and toward what purposes it is designed.


## Core Pillar IV: Digital Sovereignty and the Jurisdictional Layer

Digital Sovereignty bridges Data (content) and Network (conduit), addressing cloud jurisdiction, algorithm governance, and Indigenous AI. 

### Data Residency vs. Data Sovereignty

Data has weight. Data centers consume land, water, and electricity at scales that register in the physical world, and these impacts fall disproportionately on Indigenous communities whose territories often contain the cheap power and water that hyperscalers seek. Current GPU utilization averages only 20-40% of theoretical capacity due to memory bandwidth constraints, meaning data centers operate far below their potential efficiency while still demanding enormous resources. Infrastructure capital costs represent approximately 75% of total data center expenses while energy accounts for only 2%, a 42:1 ratio that reveals where the true investment lies: not in operational efficiency but in unchecked buildout.

This is the material reality of digital sovereignty: the servers that store data, the cables that transmit it, the cooling systems that sustain it all occupy space, consume resources, and generate consequences that Indigenous communities experience on the ground. Sovereignty over data requires sovereignty over the infrastructure that holds it. Te Mana Raraunga (The Māori Data Sovereignty Network) and Dr. Tahu Kukutai distinguish between data residency and data sovereignty. Data residency refers to physical storage location (a server in Sydney, for example). Data sovereignty refers to the laws and governance structures that determine who holds authority over the data, how it may be used, and under what conditions Physical location often dictates legal jurisdiction. If Māori data is stored in an AWS data center in Australia, it may be subject to Australian law and potentially accessible to the US government via the CLOUD Act, regardless of Māori sovereignty assertions. The data may technically belong to the community, but if it resides in infrastructure governed by foreign law, that belonging becomes precarious. This highlights the need for Sovereign Data Centers: physical facilities on Tribal lands or within jurisdictions that recognize Indigenous data rights. Research points to "On-Nation" cloud solutions or "Trusted Cloud" zones where Indigenous law is the primary jurisdiction; the question shifts from where data is stored to whose law governs it, and whether that governance reflects the values and priorities of the Peoples from whom the data originates.

### Indigenous AI and Algorithmic Sovereignty

Is AI good or bad? Will it save or destroy us? This framing obscures a fundamental truth: AI systems are human creations, and the harms attributed to them are human-caused problems requiring human accountability. Bias encoding discrimination into automated decisions. Privacy erosion. Accountability gaps. Job displacement and widening inequality. Cognitive degradation as outsourced thinking stifles critical engagement. Security risks from misinformation and hallucination. Each concern traces back to human choices. Who designed the system? Whose data trained it? Who benefits? Who bears the costs? Who has authority to change it? The technology is not the actor. Humans are. Dr. Daniel Wildcat offers essential clarity: "Some argue that AI is a good tool that will help solve our climate crisis, human hunger, healthcare issues. Maybe, but it depends on who is using it. People who are driven by less virtuous social, environmental, and justice-forward outcomes can use AI for selfish ends: accumulating wealth at the expense of humans and the environment, and calculating where the weakest and most exploitable peoples in our current global system of inequality reside so they might be used in an AI game of winner takes all.

The lack of guardrails for AI development and applications is dangerous." This is not a debate about technology. It is a question of governance, self-determination, and the right of Peoples to shape the systems that affect their lives. "Examining AI through an Indigenous lens offers important insights on this new technology," Wildcat points out. The deep relationality of many Indigenous traditions points precisely to the problem with artificial (human-made) intelligence: AI is a machine, a data-processing machine. The question is not whether AI is good or bad, but how governance structures can ensure these tools serve relational accountability rather than extractive accumulation. Who decides? According to what values? Accountable to whom?

As AI models require massive datasets for training, Indigenous Knowledge is increasingly at risk of being scraped from the open web without consent. This represents a new extraction frontier where cultural knowledge is commodified by large language models. LLMs do not understand language. They process statistical relationships, converting words into high-dimensional vectors positioned in mathematical space based on co-occurrence patterns. The model predicts probable outputs by calculating distances within this vector space, selecting tokens that minimize statistical surprise. Language becomes probability distribution. Meaning becomes dimensional proximity. The sacred becomes a coordinate. In Tribal traditions, knowledge is not merely about the human brain but about understanding co-created with the life around us: land, air, water, and the biology all three support. Knowledge is embodied knowing. Through mindfulness of deep relationality over time, we may acquire wisdom, a maturity resulting from experiential richness through kinship. AI systems can process information, identify patterns, generate predictions. They cannot know in the relational sense Indigenous epistemologies recognize. They cannot be accountable to kin. They cannot fulfill obligations to the Beings whose data they process.

Indigenous communities face a language crisis of staggering proportions. Of approximately 7,000 languages spoken today, nearly half are endangered, with Indigenous languages constituting the majority threatened with extinction. Some view LLMs as preservation opportunity: encode the language, train the model, save the words. But what exactly are we saving? To relegate language to data without sovereignty transforms living language into artifact. Indigenous languages evolve in continuous relation to environment, culture, and Beings. It is irresponsible to encode Indigenous data and consider it "saved." Without speakers, ceremony, and relational context, archived language becomes museum specimen. Treating digitization as preservation may hasten extinction by creating the illusion that the work is done, that communities can relax because the machine remembers. The machine does not remember. The machine computes. Computation without relation is not knowledge. It is extraction by another name.


## Determination over Defense: Architects of Digital Territories

**Convergence Systems Architecture** recognizes that Indigenous Data Sovereignty, Network Sovereignty, and Digital Sovereignty are not separate projects but interdependent dimensions of a single imperative: the right of Indigenous Peoples to govern their information environments according to their own laws, values, and obligations. Data flows through networks. Networks depend on infrastructure. Infrastructure enables or constrains digital futures. Sovereignty must extend across all layers or gaps emerge where extraction enters. This framework refuses the false separation of technical from political, digital from material, data from the Beings data describes. It insists that the question is never merely technical. It is always relational. Who benefits? Who decides? Accountable to whom? 

Convergence offers no neutral ground because none exists. There is only the choice between governance structures that serve Indigenous self-determination or systems that reproduce colonial logics by other means. The path forward requires Indigenous Peoples not as participants in frameworks designed elsewhere but as architects of the digital territories they will inhabit should they choose to do so. Care and continuation... a traditional worldview of Relatives, not resources. Sovereignty, not access. Self-determination, not inclusion. Convergence is only a definition of movement where many disparate entities grow closer in a determined space.

The work does not center convergence alone, but what emerges from it: **coherence**
where the parts finally remember they were never separate...

## Principles of Convergence Systems Architecture

**Sovereignty is Indivisible.** Data, network, and digital sovereignty are interdependent. Gaps in any layer create openings for extraction.

**Data is Relational.** Data describes Beings, emerges from relationships, and carries obligations. It is never neutral raw material.

**Infrastructure is Territory.** Physical networks, spectrum, and data centers constitute digital territories requiring Indigenous governance.

**Relatives, Not Resources.** Land, water, data, and all Beings hold inherent rights and responsibilities. To treat relatives as resources is harm.

**Human Accountability for Human Artifacts.** Technology does not act. Humans design, deploy, and benefit. Governance must assign responsibility accordingly.

**Self-Determination, Not Inclusion.** The question is not access to systems designed elsewhere but authority to design systems that reflect Indigenous values.

**Knowledge is Embodied.** Wisdom emerges through lived relationship with land, kin, and ceremony. Computation without relation is not knowledge.

**Convergence Without Homogenization.** Different Peoples orient around shared problems while retaining distinct identities, methods, and ways of knowing.

**Data for Governance, Not Governance of Data.** Indigenous Peoples require data reflecting their own priorities, not comparative statistics serving state administration.

**Living Systems, Not Archives.** Languages, cultures, and Knowledge evolve in relation. Digitization without sovereignty creates museum specimens, not preservation.

**The Question is Balance.** Who benefits? Who decides? Accountable to whom? Technical questions are governance questions.

**No Neutral Ground.** Every system either serves Indigenous self-determination or reproduces colonial logics. Architecture encodes values.



## Annotated Bibliography

This bibliography provides essential building materials to understand pillars of Data, Network, and Digital Sovereignty. While the publications are well-theorized individually, the convergence of the ecological, technical, and political frames provide insight into decolonizing data and advancing the rights and responsibilities of Indigenous Peoples within the technosphere. The indigenous data sovereignty movement has shifted from asserting rights (UNDRIP, 2007) to defining principles (CARE, 2019) to building infrastructure (Network Sovereignty, 2017-Present). The current moment (2025) is defined by the need for intentional and self-deterministic convergence systems architecture to navigate the rapidly emerging growth of information communication technology, and define operational standards for responsible implementation and usage of data.
