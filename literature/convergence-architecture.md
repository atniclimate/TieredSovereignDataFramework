# Convergence Architecture: Designing Sovereignty at the Intersection of Indigenous Data, Networks, and Digital Infrastructure

## Introduction: The Imperative of Convergence in Indigenous STS

Digital platforms offer Indigenous Peoples opportunities for cultural revitalization, political mobilization, and global solidarity. The underlying architectures of these systems—from raw material extraction for devices to fiber optic cable ownership and cloud server governance—remain entrenched in colonial logics.

This document defines Convergence Architecture within Indigenous Science, Technology, and Society (STS) as the sociotechnical and political synthesis of Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDSov), Digital Sovereignty, and Network Sovereignty.

Academic and policy discourse typically treats these three pillars as distinct domains. Indigenous Data Sovereignty gets relegated to archives, health statistics, and research ethics. Network Sovereignty falls under telecommunications policy, the "digital divide," and rural infrastructure. Digital Sovereignty becomes a matter of international jurisprudence and cloud residency.

The comprehensive review of core scholars (Dr. Dominique David-Chavez, Dr. Lydia Jennings) and the expanded circle (Dr. Stephanie Russo Carroll, Dr. Tahu Kukutai, Dr. Maggie Walter, Dr. Marisa Elena Duarte) reveals these distinctions are collapsing. Physical network infrastructure dictates data jurisdiction. Ethical data governance relies on infrastructure technical capabilities. Both are rooted in material realities of Indigenous lands.

A sovereign data ecosystem cannot exist without sovereign network infrastructure. This analysis utilizes a "Soil to Server" framework synthesizing the work of these scholars. It begins with material connection to land and the critique of extractive research models, moves through governance frameworks protecting Indigenous knowledge, examines physical and spectral infrastructure required to transmit that knowledge, and concludes with Indigenous AI and computational sovereignty.

### From Inclusion to Sovereignty

Indigenous engagement with Western science and technology has moved from exclusion to inclusion to sovereignty. Early paradigms excluded Indigenous peoples entirely or treated them as subjects of study. "Inclusion" models sought to bring Indigenous peoples into Western data sets and grant access to Western internet infrastructure. Inclusion without structural change accelerates extraction—what scholars describe as "digital colonialism."

Dr. Dominique David-Chavez's work on the Relational Science Model and Dr. Lydia Jennings' critique of the Open Science ecosystem demonstrate that "opening" data or "connecting" communities causes harm if governance structures are not Indigenous-led. Convergence Architecture requires fundamental re-engineering where software (governance protocols like CARE), hardware (network infrastructure and spectrum), and "wetware" (community values and biocultural knowledge) are mutually reinforcing.

This document aggregates the bibliographic tools to construct this architecture, moving beyond deficit-based views of the "digital divide" toward asset-based views of sovereign innovation.

## Core Pillar I: Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDSov) and the Governance Layer

The foundational layer of Convergence Architecture is Indigenous Data Sovereignty. IDSov is the right of Indigenous Peoples to govern collection, ownership, and application of data about their peoples, lands, and resources. It provides the ethical specifications for how the entire system functions—the legal and moral code dictating information flow through the network.

### From "Data Deficits" to "Data for Governance"

The demographic and statistical work of Dr. Tahu Kukutai and Dr. Maggie Walter challenges epistemological foundations of how Indigenous data is collected and used by settler-colonial states.

Dr. Maggie Walter coined the term "5D Data" to describe the standard colonial approach to Indigenous statistics: data used to highlight Disparity, Deprivation, Disadvantage, Dysfunction, and Difference. This deficit narrative justifies state intervention and paternalism while obscuring community strengths, resilience, and vitality. The data collected is data about Indigenous peoples, used for state administration.

IDSov advocates for "Data for Governance" rather than "Governance of Data." This distinction, elaborated in *Indigenous Data Sovereignty: Toward an Agenda* (2016), argues that tribes need data reflecting their own worldviews and priorities—language fluency rates, intergenerational knowledge transfer, environmental health metrics—rather than comparative statistics with non-Indigenous populations.

Dr. Tahu Kukutai expands on this by identifying risks of "statistical genocide" or erasure within national censuses. When data systems fail to accurately capture tribal affiliation or rely on aggregate categories masking distinct national identities, they erase Indigenous existence in the policy landscape. The first step in Convergence Architecture is designing data systems capable of "seeing" Indigenous nations as they see themselves.

### Operationalizing Ethics: The CARE Principles

If the "what" of IDSov is sovereign data, the "how" is the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance. Developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA) with leadership from Dr. Stephanie Russo Carroll, CARE represents the most significant global framework for operationalizing IDSov in the era of Big Data.

CARE was designed to complement and critique the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) used in Western scientific data management. FAIR focuses on data characteristics facilitating machine-readability and sharing but remains silent on human relationships, power dynamics, and ethical obligations.

**Collective Benefit:** Data ecosystems must enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit, countering extractive history where value was exported to academic or corporate centers.

**Authority to Control:** Indigenous rights and interests must be recognized and their authority to control data empowered, including rights to repatriate data and refuse participation.

**Responsibility:** Those working with data have responsibility to share how data supports Indigenous self-determination.

**Ethics:** Indigenous rights and wellbeing must be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle.

Dr. Dominique David-Chavez and Dr. Stephanie Russo Carroll demonstrate that "Open Data" often conflicts with Indigenous protections. The principle "As open as possible, as closed as necessary" encapsulates the Convergence approach: technical standards ensuring interoperability (FAIR) combined with governance standards ensuring sovereignty (CARE).

### The Relational Science Model

Dr. Dominique David-Chavez provides methodological scaffolding for this governance layer. Her work on the Relational Science Model critiques extractive colonial science where researchers "parachute" into communities to extract data without building capacity or relationships.

In her analysis of global Indigenous ethics guidelines, David-Chavez identifies that sovereignty in research requires moving up the "scale of engagement" from consultation to Indigenous-led and Indigenous-determined research. This involves implementing "Tribal Research Codes" with the force of law, requiring external researchers to undergo tribal IRB review and adhere to community protocols regarding data sharing and intellectual property. This legal infrastructure transforms ethical "guidelines" into enforceable "governance."

## Core Pillar II: The Material Turn – Land, Water, and "The Soil"

Convergence Architecture recognizes that data is material—biological and geological. Dr. Lydia Jennings bridges the gap between ecological sovereignty and data sovereignty, forcing reconsideration of what constitutes "Indigenous Data" beyond cultural artifacts and health records to include soil samples, water quality metrics, and biodiversity data.

### From Metal Mining to Data Mining

Jennings draws on expertise as a soil scientist and policy scholar to argue that extraction logic is identical in metal mining and data mining. Settler-colonialism viewed Indigenous lands as terra nullius available for mineral extraction. The modern data economy views Indigenous knowledge and biophysical data as "raw resources" available for harvesting.

In both cases, value is extracted and exported to the metropole (universities, corporations, urban centers) while "waste"—toxic tailings or harmful narratives—is left in the community. Jennings' work on mining land reclamation serves as metaphor for data landscape reclamation. Just as soil must be remediated to support life, data ecosystems must be remediated to support Indigenous futurities.

### Biophysical Data Sovereignty and "Water Back"

Biophysical Data Sovereignty posits that data generated from the land—soil health, plant biodiversity, water chemistry—is inherently Indigenous data because it reflects relationships Indigenous peoples have held with that land for millennia. This brings Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, satellite remote sensing, and environmental monitoring networks under the IDSov umbrella.

Jennings collaborates with Dr. Dominique David-Chavez and Dr. Stephanie Russo Carroll to apply CARE principles to ecology and biodiversity research. The "Water Back" framework links the "Land Back" movement to "Data Back." True sovereignty over water resources requires sovereignty over water data. If the state controls hydrological data, they control scarcity and allocation narratives. Convergence Architecture must include independent, tribal-controlled environmental monitoring networks generating sovereign data for legal claims and resource management.

### Embodied Data and Narrative Sovereignty

Jennings emphasizes the embodied nature of data. Her 50-mile run honoring Indigenous scientists acts as "running as research" methodology, connecting physical exertion on the land with intellectual scholarship. Data is stored in the body and the land, not just servers. Convergence Architecture must honor embodied data and oral histories, creating technological systems that preserve non-textual knowledge forms without reducing them to binary code.

## Core Pillar III: Network Sovereignty and the Infrastructure Layer

If IDSov provides the laws (Software), Network Sovereignty provides the territory (Hardware). Without ownership of physical infrastructure, data sovereignty is difficult to enforce. Data may be legally owned by the tribe, but if it resides on servers and travels through fiber optic cables owned by entities not recognizing tribal jurisdiction, that sovereignty is precarious.

### Defining Network Sovereignty

Dr. Marisa Elena Duarte's monograph *Network Sovereignty: Building the Internet Across Indian Country* (2017) is the definitive text for this layer. Duarte shifts conversation from "digital divide" (deficit model focusing on lack of access) to "network sovereignty" (rights-based model focusing on infrastructure control).

Tribes cannot be fully sovereign nations in the 21st century without controlling information flows. This includes physical fiber optic cables, microwave towers, internet exchange points (IXPs), and spectrum frequencies. US internet infrastructure often follows historical pathways of colonial railroads and telegraph lines, physically reinforcing settler geographies and bypassing tribal lands.

### The "Social Textures" of Connectivity

In collaborative work with computer scientist Dr. Morgan Vigil-Hayes, Duarte explores "social textures" of connectivity in rural and tribal communities. Standard engineering metrics like "throughput" and "latency" fail to capture relational value of connectivity in Indigenous contexts.

Research on Tribal ISPs and mesh networks demonstrates that tribes design infrastructure differently. Instead of routing traffic through distant commercial hubs (increasing latency and cost), tribal networks prioritize connecting a Chapter House directly to a local health clinic or school. This "local routing" physically manifests Convergence Architecture—network topology reflects community social structure and priorities.

### Spectrum Sovereignty: Decolonizing the Airwaves

The electromagnetic spectrum is typically treated by the state as a federal asset auctioned to the highest bidder (usually massive telecommunications corporations). This results in "spectrum squatting" where companies hold licenses for spectrum over tribal lands but fail to build infrastructure, blocking tribes from using that spectrum themselves.

Convergence Architecture involves asserting Spectrum Sovereignty—tribal rights to manage airwaves over their territories. Duarte and Vigil-Hayes explore technical solutions like opportunistic spectrum access and TV White Space (TVWS) use. This allows tribes to build "intranets" physically and logically distinct from the open internet, enabling higher degrees of data sovereignty and security.

## Core Pillar IV: Digital Sovereignty and the Jurisdictional Layer

Digital Sovereignty bridges Data (content) and Network (conduit). It addresses "Cloud" jurisdiction, algorithm governance, and Indigenous AI.

### Data Residency vs. Data Sovereignty

Te Mana Raraunga (The Māori Data Sovereignty Network) and Dr. Tahu Kukutai distinguish between data residency and data sovereignty. Data Residency refers to physical storage location (e.g., a server in Sydney, Australia). Data Sovereignty refers to laws and governance structures governing the data.

Physical location often dictates legal jurisdiction. If Māori data is stored in an AWS data center in Australia, it may be subject to Australian law and potentially accessible to the US government via the CLOUD Act, regardless of Māori sovereignty assertions. This highlights the need for Sovereign Data Centers—physical facilities on tribal lands or within jurisdictions respecting Indigenous data rights. Research points to "On-Nation" cloud solutions or "Trusted Cloud" zones where Indigenous law is the primary jurisdiction.

### Indigenous AI and Algorithmic Sovereignty

As AI models require massive datasets for training, Indigenous knowledge is increasingly at risk of being "scraped" from the open web without consent. This represents a new extraction frontier where cultural knowledge is commodified by large language models (LLMs).

Scholars like Dr. Keolu Fox argue for Sovereign Compute. This extends sovereignty to processing power itself—tribes need their own data and networks but also their own computational infrastructure (GPUs, TPUs) to train their own models. This enables AI creation reflecting Indigenous logic—relationality and accountability to land—rather than Silicon Valley extractive logic.

Convergence Architecture in this domain involves designing AI systems respecting "protocols" of knowledge sharing where some information is sacred and restricted rather than "open" to all.

## Synthesis: The "Soil to Server" Framework for Convergence Architecture

The synthesis reveals a gap: the connection between data governance (Carroll/Kukutai) and network physics (Duarte/Jennings) is treated theoretically rather than architecturally. Convergence Architecture can define implementation standards for this field.

Based on Jennings' materialist ecology and Duarte's infrastructure studies, this "Soil to Server" integrated framework guides the inquiry:

**1. The Source (Soil/Body):** Where data is generated. (Literature: Jennings, David-Chavez). Data is not "raw"; it is born from land and bodies.

**2. The Extraction/Collection:** How data is gathered. (Literature: Kukutai, Walter). This critiques the "deficit model" and proposes "Indigenous statistics" and "data for governance."

**3. The Transmission (Network):** How data moves. (Literature: Duarte). This focuses on spectrum, fiber, and "social textures" of connectivity.

**4. The Storage (Cloud/Archive):** Where data rests. (Literature: Carroll, Te Mana Raraunga). This deals with data centers, residency, and CARE principles.

**5. The Application (AI/Policy):** How data is used. (Literature: Indigenous AI, Future Imaginaries). This looks at Sovereign AI and digital self-determination futures.

## Strategic Analysis: The Roadmap

The movement has shifted from asserting rights (UNDRIP, 2007) to defining principles (CARE, 2019) to building infrastructure (Network Sovereignty, 2017-Present). The current moment (2025) is defined by the need for Sovereign Compute and Sovereign AI.

While the pillars of Data, Network, and Digital Sovereignty are well-theorized individually, their convergence is the frontier. Convergence Architecture can define implementation standards for this field.

## Recommendations

To successfully design Convergence Architecture:

**Re-materialize Data:** Adopt Jennings' approach linking data back to land and body.

**Infrastructure as Governance:** Adopt Duarte's approach viewing towers and cables as political assertions of sovereignty.

**Sovereign Compute:** Move beyond storage to processing, ensuring the "brain" of AI is as sovereign as the "memory" of the archive.

This bibliography provides essential building materials for that architecture. By weaving together the ecological, technical, and political, this work can move Indigenous STS from critique of colonial systems to construction of sovereign futures.
