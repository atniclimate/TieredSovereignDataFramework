## Executive Summary

Governance frameworks for Indigenous-controlled environmental data repositories in partnership with federal, state, or academic institutions include three main components: formal data sovereignty standards, legal and statutory mandates, and community-based review structures that ensure Indigenous oversight of data collection, storage, and use.

## Abstract

Indigenous-controlled environmental data repositories built in partnership with federal, state, or academic institutions operate under frameworks that combine formal data sovereignty principles with community-led oversight. Studies describe governance models that include:

1. **Formal data sovereignty standards** such as the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance, Ownership, Control, Access, Possession (OCAP) protocols, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

2. **Legal and statutory mandates** such as the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Indian Act paired with Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, and other legislative tools that support co-management.

3. **Community-based review and co-management structures**, including Tribal Research Review Boards, land claim agreements, and advisory councils that ensure that decisions about data collection, storage, and use reflect Indigenous cultural protocols.

Partnerships are diverse; academic collaborators appear in 27 studies and federal institutions in 18, while arrangements with state, municipal, and other organizations further shape governance. These studies report that such frameworks govern a wide range of environmental data—from traditional ecological knowledge to water quality and climate data—and that they strive to respect cultural and intellectual property rights even as power-sharing and technical challenges vary by context.

## Methodology

### Paper Search

A semantic search was performed using the query "What governance frameworks exist for Indigenous-controlled environmental data repositories that involve partnerships with federal, state, or academic institutions?" across over 138 million academic papers from the Elicit search engine, which includes all of Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex.

The following filters were applied: study types: Review; with PDF available.

The 500 papers most relevant to the query were retrieved.

### Screening

Sources were screened based on the following criteria:

- **Indigenous Control:** Does the study focus on environmental data repositories that are owned, managed, or controlled by Indigenous communities, Tribes, or trusted Indigenous organizations?
- **Environmental Data Focus:** Does the study involve repositories containing environmental data (e.g., climate, biodiversity, natural resources, land use, water quality, etc.)?
- **Governance Framework Documentation:** Does the study describe, analyze, or evaluate governance structures, policies, frameworks, protocols, or management systems for these repositories? Include: "data governance," OR "data management agreements," OR "memoranda of understanding", etc.
- **Partnership Involvement:** Does the study involve partnerships, collaborations, or formal relationships between Indigenous entities and federal agencies, state/provincial governments, and/or academic institutions?
- **Genetic Reference?:** Exclude studies related to genetics, genomics, human health
- **Contemporary Relevance:** Does the study address current practical governance frameworks for federally recognized Tribes or Canadian First Nations or contemporary repository management practices (not purely historical practices without connection to present-day applications)?
- **Does this apply to United States and/or Canadian First Nations?:** Only find studies with focus on United States Tribes or Canadian First Nations; broad literature review on data sovereignty, co-creation, knowledge management, etc. is acceptable

All screening questions were considered together, and a holistic judgement was made about whether to screen in each paper.

### Data Extraction

A large language model was used to extract each data column from each paper. The model was given the following extraction instructions for each column:

**Governance Framework:** Extract the specific governance framework(s), principles, policies, or mechanisms described, including name/type of framework (e.g., CARE Principles, tribal research policies, data sovereignty protocols), core components or elements of the framework, whether it's formal policy, informal guidelines, or conceptual framework, level of implementation (tribal, institutional, project-specific), and any standards or criteria the framework establishes.

**Indigenous Control Mechanisms:** Document how Indigenous sovereignty and control are maintained within the framework, including decision-making authority retained by Indigenous communities, consent processes and requirements, data ownership and access rights, community oversight or governance structures, mechanisms for asserting tribal/Indigenous sovereignty, and collective vs individual control provisions.

**Partnership Structure:** Extract details about partnerships with external institutions, including types of partner institutions (federal agencies, state governments, universities, etc.), roles and responsibilities of each partner, power dynamics and authority distribution, formal agreements, MOUs, or treaties involved, how partnerships are initiated and maintained, and benefit-sharing arrangements.

**Environmental Data Type:** Identify the specific environmental data or repository being governed, including type of environmental data (water quality, biodiversity, climate, traditional ecological knowledge, etc.), data collection methods and sources, storage and repository systems (databases, archives, PGIS platforms, etc.), scale of data (local, regional, national), and cultural or traditional knowledge components.

**Implementation Context:** Extract contextual information about how and where the framework operates, including geographic location and jurisdictional context, specific Indigenous communities or nations involved, legal/regulatory environment, technological infrastructure requirements, timeline of development and implementation, and funding sources and sustainability mechanisms.

**Benefits and Outcomes:** Document the positive outcomes, benefits, or successes of the governance framework, including benefits to Indigenous communities (collective benefit, capacity building, etc.), environmental or conservation outcomes, successful collaboration examples, knowledge preservation or sharing achievements, community empowerment or sovereignty strengthening, and research or policy impacts.

**Challenges and Barriers:** Extract identified challenges, limitations, or barriers to implementation, including technical or infrastructure limitations, resource constraints (funding, personnel, technology), legal or jurisdictional obstacles, institutional resistance or conflicts, cultural or ethical tensions, power imbalances in partnerships, and sustainability concerns.

**Framework Evolution:** Document how the governance framework has developed or changed over time, including historical development or origins, adaptations or modifications made, lessons learned and applied, future directions or planned improvements, influence on other frameworks or policies, and scaling or replication efforts.

## Thematic Analysis

### Indigenous Data Sovereignty Frameworks

**Centrality of Data Sovereignty:** Many studies report the centrality of Indigenous data sovereignty in governance frameworks for environmental data repositories. Formal frameworks such as the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance and the First Nations Principles of Ownership, Control, Access, Possession (OCAP) are widely referenced and, in some cases, operationalized at tribal, institutional, or project levels. These frameworks emphasize collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, and ethics, and are often implemented alongside or in response to international instruments such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

**Community-led Governance Structures:** Community-led governance structures, such as Tribal Research Review Boards (TRRBs), community review boards, and advisory boards, are increasingly used to assert Indigenous authority over research and data. These mechanisms are described as aiming to ensure that data collection, storage, and use align with community values and priorities, and that consent processes are robust and culturally appropriate.

**Variation in Implementation:** The degree of implementation and effectiveness of these frameworks varies. Some studies report strong Indigenous control over data and decision-making, while others note ongoing challenges in achieving meaningful sovereignty, particularly where legal recognition or resources are lacking.

### Partnership Models and Power Dynamics

**Diversity of Partnership Structures:** Partnerships with federal, state, or academic institutions are common but highly variable in structure and power distribution. Many studies describe co-management arrangements, formalized through land claim agreements, memoranda of understanding, or statutory mechanisms. Others highlight project-specific collaborations, often guided by principles or expectations documents.

**Roles and Power Sharing:** The roles and responsibilities of partners are diverse, with Indigenous communities variously positioned as knowledge holders, co-researchers, or decision-makers. Some partnerships are characterized by equitable power sharing and mutual benefit, while others are marked by persistent power imbalances, with non-Indigenous institutions retaining significant authority over data and decision-making.

**Benefit-Sharing Arrangements:** Benefit-sharing arrangements are inconsistently reported. Where present, they include capacity building, employment, training, and economic benefits. The initiation and maintenance of partnerships often depend on formal agreements, sustained funding, and ongoing relationship-building.

### Environmental Data Governance Mechanisms

**Types of Data:** The types of environmental data governed under these frameworks are diverse, including traditional ecological knowledge, water quality, biodiversity, climate data, contaminated sites, and cultural heritage materials. Several studies highlight the integration of traditional and scientific knowledge within the same repository, particularly in co-management or community-led models.

**Data Collection and Storage:** Data collection methods range from community-based participatory research and interviews to field sampling and remote sensing. Storage and repository systems include tribal archives, georeferenced databases, participatory Geographic Information Systems (GIS) platforms, and digital atlases. The scale of data governance varies from local to national and even global, with some repositories integrating both scientific and traditional knowledge components.

**Cultural and Intellectual Property Considerations:** Cultural and traditional knowledge is often central to these repositories, with frameworks emphasizing the need for culturally appropriate data management, respect for intellectual property, and the preservation of oral histories and Indigenous languages.

### Implementation Challenges and Facilitators

**Technical and Infrastructure Limitations:** Technical and infrastructure limitations, such as inadequate digital platforms, limited internet access, and lack of standardized data management systems, are common.

**Resource Constraints:** Resource constraints, including insufficient funding, personnel, and training, are widely reported.

**Legal and Jurisdictional Obstacles:** Legal and jurisdictional obstacles, such as fragmented regulatory environments, lack of recognition of Indigenous legal systems, and overlapping claims, impede the implementation of governance frameworks.

**Institutional Resistance:** Institutional resistance, including entrenched bureaucratic practices and reluctance to share power, is a persistent barrier.

**Cultural and Ethical Tensions:** Cultural and ethical tensions arise from differences in worldviews, historical mistrust, and concerns about the misuse or decontextualization of Indigenous knowledge.

**Power Imbalances:** Power imbalances in partnerships are frequently cited, with calls for more equitable arrangements and greater Indigenous leadership.

**Facilitators of Success:** Facilitators of successful implementation include long-term funding, capacity building, formal recognition of Indigenous authority, and the development of culturally appropriate protocols and guidelines.

---

## Summary

The included studies demonstrate a growing landscape of governance frameworks for Indigenous-controlled environmental data repositories involving partnerships with federal, state, or academic institutions. Key findings include:

- **Increasing adoption of formal data sovereignty principles** such as the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance and Ownership, Control, Access, Possession (OCAP).

- **Emergence of community-led governance structures** (e.g., Tribal Research Review Boards, advisory boards) to assert Indigenous authority over research and data.

- **Significant variation in partnership models and power dynamics**, with some studies reporting equitable arrangements and others highlighting persistent imbalances.

- **Diverse types of environmental data and repository systems**, often integrating both traditional and scientific knowledge.

- **Ongoing challenges** related to technical infrastructure, resources, legal recognition, institutional resistance, and cultural tensions.

- **Facilitators of success** include long-term funding, capacity building, formal recognition of Indigenous authority, and culturally appropriate protocols.

The diversity of contexts, data types, and partnership models underscores the need for flexible, context-specific approaches that prioritize Indigenous rights, knowledge, and leadership, as reported in the included studies.
